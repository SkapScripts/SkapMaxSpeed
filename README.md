Thanks for using my very simple "script"!
This is a very simple "script" we made for my server, That we use and works perfectly.
With this script, You can lock every vehicle to a specific max speed.
It won't do so every vehicles goes the speed you choose, But it will do so vehicles can't go over the speed to choose in Config.MaxSpeed . 
Except for those vehicles you put in "by hand". Like i've done, The maxspeed is 300, But for police vehicles it is 260.

if you got any questions or things we can do better in this resource, Let me know!
